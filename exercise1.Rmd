* I'm not in Evans school though: *I'm from* _College of Built Environments_.
* But, I'm taking a class: **PUBPOL** __543__.

If you need bullets:

* One *bullet*
* **another** one.

This is where you add a small piece of R code:

```{r}
1+2
```

You will write several of those pieces later [@ruppertStatisticsDataAnalysis2015a].

Finally, you can add a citation using **citr** after the word __"work"__:

All this work will be based on previous work [@magallanesreyesIntroducingDataScience2017].
